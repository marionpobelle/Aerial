# Presentation

The Aerial Image Recognition Challenge consists in sorting different landscape images ranging from beaches, lakes, forests, meadows and more.

# Data

Data comes from part of the data set (NWPU-RESISC45) originally used in the paper Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification. This data set contains 45 categories while we only kept 13 out of them as a first preprocessing.

# Development

This solution to the Aerial Image Recognition Challenge was developed using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) over the course of 2 months. The group members were KHATER Yara, [POBELLE Marion](https://github.com/marionpobelle) and [SERRE GaÃ«tan](https://github.com/gaetanserre).

We first used an instance of the REsNet50 model that is already trained on the [ImageNet](https://www.image-net.org/) dataset. We obtained stable results for our loss and accuracy.

As the pretrained ResNet50 model was really performant, we decided to recreate its architecture but without any pretrained weights. Once again we obtained great results on loss and accuracy.
