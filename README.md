# Data

Data comes from part of the data set (NWPU-RESISC45) originally used in the paper Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification. This data set contains 45 categories while we only kept 13 out of them as a first preprocessing.

# Development

This solution to the Aerial Image Recognition Challenge was developed using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) over the course of 2 months. The group members were KHATER Yara, POBELLE Marion and SERRE GaÃ«tan.

FINISH TOMORROW
