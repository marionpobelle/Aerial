# Presentation

The Aerial Image Recognition Challenge consists in sorting different landscape images ranging from beaches, lakes, forests, meadows and more.

# Data

Data comes from part of the data set (NWPU-RESISC45) originally used in the paper Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification. This data set contains 45 categories while we only kept 13 out of them as a first preprocessing.
